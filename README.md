# Aircraft-Taxxing-Time-Calculation
Aircraft Taxiing Time and Fuel cost Calculation using ADSB API

**Objective:**
The Purpose of this project is to calculate the time taken by an airline to taxi from the terminal to 
the Runway and inturn calculate the fuel cost incurred by airlines in taxxing. This Taxiing time calculation will intunr
help airlines calculate the fuel cost incurred due to delays at airports caused by various factors such as weather or traffic
or RWY incidences. The ADSB API was used which tracks all the aircrafts within the 10nm radius of the ARP of any airport.
We calculated this data for all US major airports to get a dashboard which will give the aircraft status such as on ground or takeoff
as well as time taken before aircraft is 50ft off the ground.
